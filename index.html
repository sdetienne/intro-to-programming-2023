    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Scherly Etienne, and I am excited to share my journey to becoming a front-end web developer. I am currently in the Intro to Programming program with Code The Dream. This is my second bootcamp experience and I am excited to continue my coding journey. While completing classes, I am gaining knowledge to help me reach goals I did not think I could achieve. While I am a beginner and changing career paths, I am excited to share more information about me and my work. I am also excited to see where I go! </p>
